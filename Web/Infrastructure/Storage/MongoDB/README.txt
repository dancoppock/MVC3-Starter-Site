Hi, it's me... Rob...

This is our fledgiling MongoDB driver, NoRM, which I helped to build (the Linq stuff). It's a document
database that's screaming fast and is a great option for your "application" data (non-reporting stuff).

If you want to know more - here's a blog post I wrote...

To setup Mongo, go get it from http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Downloads
And then drop the unzipped files in C:\Mongo
Create a directory call C:\data. This is where you data goes by default (you can override this if you like – see the docs)
Run C:\Mongo\bin\mongod.exe
