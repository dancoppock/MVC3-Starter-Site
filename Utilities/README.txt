Hi, it's me... Rob...

This Tasks project is for you to do things that developers typically have to do in the course of
web development. Things like...

>>> Dev tasks, like perhaps minifying your javascript and CSS
>>> Reporting tasks like scraping the database and pulling out interesting stuff into a CSV and emailing it to your boss..
>>> Email tasks like notifying all your users about something
>>> "Chron" tasks like purging your log files...
>>> Code-generation stuff you want to do yourself...

There are a ton of things that require a bit of automation, and this is your tool. I made a little 
minifier for you... have fun...
